# Payment Details Display Update

## Overview
Updated customer-facing order pages to display payment information including payment method and transaction ID.

## Changes Made

### 1. Order Detail Page (`OrderDetailPage.jsx`)
**Location:** `/order/:orderId`

**Updated Payment Information Section:**
- Changed "Payment Method" to "Payment Information"
- Now displays:
  - ✅ Payment Method (PhonePe / Cash on Delivery)
  - ✅ Transaction ID (when available)
  - ✅ Payment Status (when available)

**Display Logic:**
```javascript
- PhonePe payments show as "PhonePe"
- Transaction ID displayed in monospace font
- Payment status shown with color coding (green for paid, yellow for pending)
```

### 2. My Orders Page (`MyOrdersPage.jsx`)
**Location:** `/my-orders`

**Updated Order Card:**
- Added payment information below total amount
- Shows:
  - ✅ Payment method
  - ✅ Last 8 digits of transaction ID (e.g., `#abc12345`)

**Format:**
```
Total: ₹50,000
Payment: PhonePe #abc12345
```

## Backend Data Structure

### Order Model Fields
```javascript
{
  paymentMethod: String, // "phonepe" or "cod"
  transactionId: String, // Transaction ID from payment gateway
  paymentStatus: String  // (optional) "paid" or "pending"
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/orders/my-orders` - Returns all user orders with payment details
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Returns single order with payment details

## User Benefits
1. **Transparency**: Customers can see exactly how they paid
2. **Record Keeping**: Transaction IDs help customers track payments
3. **Support**: Makes customer support easier with visible transaction IDs
4. **Trust**: Shows payment status clearly

## Testing
1. Place an order with PhonePe payment
2. View order in "My Orders" page - should show payment method and transaction ID
3. Click on order to view details - should show full payment information
4. Verify transaction ID matches the actual payment

## Notes
- Transaction ID only shows if available in order
- Payment status only displays if field exists in order
- Works with both PhonePe and COD orders
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
